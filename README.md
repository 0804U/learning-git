# learning-git

The purpose of this repository is to get a handle on using version control through a task oriented implementation of instruction.

_Editing README.md file as part of learning that creating a branch is the act of duplicating the master branch so changes can be made without consequence unless those changes are wanted to be permanent. This branching of the master allows for experimentation and the like on the master branch via the copy._
